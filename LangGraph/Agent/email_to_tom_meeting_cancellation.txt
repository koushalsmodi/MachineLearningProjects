Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this email finds you well. 

I'm writing to let you know that I will not be able to make it to our scheduled meeting at 10:00 am at Canary Wharf.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, I am available tomorrow at 12pm in New York if that works for you. Please let me know if we can reschedule for that time, or if there's another time that works better for both of us. If there's anything I can review or contribute beforehand, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Koushal S Modi
